# File Transfer Including Merkle Tree

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to a robust implementation of file transfer mechanisms that incorporate Merkle Tree functionality. By integrating the Merkle Tree data structure, the system ensures data integrity, efficiency, and security during file transfers.

## Features

- **Secure File Transfer**: Implement a secure and reliable file transfer mechanism between systems.
- **Merkle Tree Integration**: Use the Merkle Tree data structure to provide efficient and secure data integrity checks.
- **Efficient Verification**: Enable rapid verification of file contents, minimizing vulnerabilities and ensuring data consistency.
- **Modular Design**: The architecture is designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy integration and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples to facilitate understanding and implementation.
